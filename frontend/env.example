# REQUIRED: Set this to your deployed API Gateway URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod

# Note: The frontend now uses API Gateway endpoints for all AWS service interactions
# DynamoDB table names, Bedrock Agent ARNs, S3 bucket names, and other AWS resource identifiers
# are handled by the backend Lambda functions and don't need to be configured here
